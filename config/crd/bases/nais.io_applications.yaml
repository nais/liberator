              description: Sometimes, applications are temporarily unable to serve
                traffic. For example, an application might need to load large data
                or configuration files during startup, or depend on external services
                after startup. In such cases, you don't want to kill the application,
                but you don’t want to send it requests either. Kubernetes provides
                readiness probes to detect and mitigate these situations. A pod with
                containers reporting that they are not ready does not receive traffic
                through Kubernetes Services. Read more about this over at the [Kubernetes
                readiness documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).
